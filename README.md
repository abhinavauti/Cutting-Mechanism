🔪🍌 Excited to share my latest project on Unity: a realistic fruit and vegetable cutting mechanism! 🍎🥕

Taking inspiration from real-world chopping experiences, I delved into Unity to craft a dynamic and immersive cutting mechanism. Here's a glimpse of what I achieved:

🌟 Key Features:
🔹 Realistic Setup: Utilized Unity to create a dynamic environment with assets like tables, chairs, chopping boards, and more.
🔹 Interactive Mechanics: Implemented intuitive controls for the chopping hand, allowing users to simulate chopping motions with precision.
🔹 Cutting Mechanism: Overcame challenges by devising a mechanism that spawns slices upon collision, delivering a satisfying chopping effect.
🔹 Animation Magic: Leveraged animations to seamlessly guide sliced pieces, enhancing realism and engagement.
🔹 Audiovisual Delight: Integrated sound effects for chopping and sliding slices, enriching the experience.
🔹 User-Friendly Interface: Designed a clear and intuitive UI to enhance usability.

🛠️ Tools Used: Unity for development, Trello for project management, and VS Code for scripting.
